          <p>In times of grief, individuals often experience a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, and confusion. Providing private spaces for small group meetings is essential to facilitate closure, offer social support, and celebrate the life of the departed. These purposes form the ultimate products of R2G RAINING GRACE FUNERAL PARLOUR (R2G). While traditional funeral homes have typically provided rituals for closure, they may not adequately address the need for social support in modern times. Our cooperative is structured to meet this need, emphasizing the importance of gathering for mutual support during the grieving process.</p>
